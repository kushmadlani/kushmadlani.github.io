Hi, my name is Kush. I'm a Masters student at UCL in London studying Machine Learning. I spent four years as an Options Trader at an Investment Bank out of university, but last year I found my passion in the world of ML and the problems it can help solve, a few months after writing my first lines of code.

In this blog I'll write about some things I learnt along the way, starting from zero, to what I'm working on today.
