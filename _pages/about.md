Hi, my name is Kush. I'm a Masters student at UCL in London studying Machine Learning. I spent four years as an options trader at an Investment Bank, then found my passion in the world of ML and the problems it can help solve. In this blog I'll write about some things I found along the way, starting from zero, to what I'm learning today.
